<p>This project covers common behaviors of difficult audience members and how to address each behavior in a calm,
effective and professional way.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> The purpose of this project is to practice the skills needed to address audience challenges when you
present outside of your Toastmasters club.</p>
<p><strong>Overview:</strong> Prepare a 5- to 7-minute speech on a topic of your choosing. You may write a new speech or use a
speech you presented previously. You will be evaluated on the way you manage audience disruptions, not the
content of your speech. Before your club meeting, send the Role Play Assignments resource to the Toastmaster and
vice president education. As you present your speech, respond to different types of difficult audience members
that disrupt you. The process of speaking and responding to audience members will take 12 to 15 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>This project includes:</strong><br /> ■  A role play assignment for club members<br /> ■  A 5- to 7-minute speech</p>
