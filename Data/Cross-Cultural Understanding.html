<p>This project focuses on understanding the cultures with which you identify and the impact of stereotypes associated with your cultures and others.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> The purpose of this project is to identify your own cultural identities and the stereotypes that impact others’ perceptions of you.</p>
<p><strong>Overview:</strong> Develop a 5- to 7-minute speech about the cultures with which you most closely identify and the personal impact of the stereotypes commonly associated with those cultures. You may need to spend some time researching the stereotypes believed about your cultures, especially if you are a member of the most dominant cultures in your geographic area. Be aware that all cultural identities have some sort of affiliated stereotype, even if it is obscure or uncommon.</p>
