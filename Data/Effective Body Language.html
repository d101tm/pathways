<p>This project focuses on how to recognize body language used when speaking publicly and how to use gestures to
enhance speech content.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> The purpose of this project is to deliver a speech with awareness of your intentional and unintentional
body language, as well as to learn, practice, and refine how you use nonverbal communication when delivering a
speech.</p>
<p><strong>Overview:</strong> Prepare a 5- to 7-minute speech on a topic that lends itself to expression through your movement and
gestures. Video record your presentation and get feedback from your mentor or another reviewer before speaking
to your club. If you do not have access to a recording device, perform your speech in front of a mirror and make
adjustments before your scheduled speech.</p>
