<p>This project addresses the skills needed to give and receive feedback. You will learn about giving, receiving and applying feedback.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> The purpose of this project is to present a speech on any topic, receive feedback, and apply the feedback to a second speech.</p>
<p><strong>Overview:</strong> Choose any topic for your first 5- to 7-minute speech. After your speech, carefully review your feedback. At a different club meeting, present a 5- to 7-minute speech in which you incorporate feedback from your first speech. You may choose to present the same speech again or a new speech. Your second speech should reflect some or all of the feedback from your first speech. Finally, after you have completed both speeches, serve as an evaluator at a club meeting and deliver constructive feedback about another member’s presentation.</p>
