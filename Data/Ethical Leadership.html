<p>This project addresses the importance of recognizing the effect of decisions that impact ethics, best practices for
making ethical decisions and developing an ethical framework.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> The purpose of this project is to develop a clear understanding of your own ethical framework and create
an opportunity for others to hear about and discuss ethics in your organization or community.</p>
<p><strong>Overview:</strong> Define an ethical framework for yourself. To do this, you may need to complete personal research
beyond the contents of this project. Then, organize and moderate a 20- to 40-minute panel discussion about
ethics, followed by a question-and-answer session. If you have never facilitated a panel discussion, review the
“Moderate a Panel Discussion” elective project.</p>
<p><strong>This project includes:</strong><br /> ■  The Ethical Framework resource<br /> ■  Organizing and moderating a panel discussion as well as a question-and-answer session</p>
