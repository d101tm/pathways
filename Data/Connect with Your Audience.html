<p>This project focuses on different audience types and how to address them effectively.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> The purpose of this project is to practice the skills needed to connect with an unfamiliar audience.</p>
<p><strong>Overview:</strong> Develop a 5- to 7-minute speech on a topic that is unfamiliar to the majority of your audience. Because you deliver this speech in your Toastmasters club, you are familiar with the audience members’ preferences and personalities.
Selecting a topic that is new or unfamiliar to your club members will allow you to practice adapting as you present. As
you speak, monitor the audience’s reaction to your topic and adapt as necessary to maintain engagement.</p>
<p><strong>This project includes:</strong><br /> ■  A 5- to 7-minute speech </p>
