<p>This project focuses on developing strategies for adding humor to any speech, especially impromptu speeches.
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> The purpose of this project is for you to develop your method for giving impromptu speeches and practice adapting rehearsed stories during a presentation.
<p><strong>Overview:</strong> You will deliver two 2- to 3-minute speeches. When you are ready to begin the first of your speeches, the Toastmaster of the Day will select a topic from the Impromptu Speech Topics resource. Your speech must last 2 to 3 minutes and include at least one anecdote that is related to the topic. When the first speech is complete, give a second 2- to 3-minute speech on a new topic. Both topics should be selected at random and without your prior knowledge.
