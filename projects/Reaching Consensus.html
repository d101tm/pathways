<p>This project focuses on reaching consensus and the importance of including all group members in the decisionmaking
process.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> The purpose of this project is to work with a group to practice reaching consensus on any topic.</p>
<p><strong>Overview:</strong> Apply the techniques described in the project to practice leading a group of people toward consensus
at a club meeting in 20 minutes. Choose a topic that will offer you and your group a challenge, but avoid topics
that you know are unlikely to reach consensus in the timeframe. (Note: It is ok if you cannot reach consensus in 20
minutes.) Then, give a 2- to 3-minute closing statement on the experience or the decision.</p>
<p>
You may also choose to lead a non-Toastmasters group toward consensus. Apply the techniques described in the
project. Choose a topic that will offer you and your group a challenge. At a club meeting, deliver a 5- to 7-minute
speech about the experience. Your speech can be persuasive, humorous, informational, or crafted in any style
that appeals to you and supports your speech content. Submit your signed Project Completion Form to the vice
president education.</p>
