<p>This project focuses on how to plan for change, develop a communication plan, and identify obstacles to success.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> The purpose of this project is to practice developing a change management plan.</p>
<p><strong>Overview:</strong> Create a change management plan for a real or hypothetical situation. You may create a plan that is based on a past change or a future change that is happening in your personal, Toastmasters, or professional life. Share your change management plan with your club in a 5- to 7-minute speech. Your speech may be humorous, informational, or any other style that appeals to you.
