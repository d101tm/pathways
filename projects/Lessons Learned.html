<p>This project addresses how to identify the discussion points of a large group meeting, encourage a culture of
contribution and voicing opinions, and facilitate productive discussion that yields results.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> The purpose of this project is to learn about and apply the skills needed to run a lessons learned meeting
during a project or after its completion.</p>
<p><strong>Overview:</strong> Facilitate a lessons learned meeting for a team with which you are completing or have completed
a project. This meeting is separate from your regular Toastmasters meeting. Organize and facilitate a discussion.
Record the results into a document you and your team members can use to facilitate the current project or future
projects. If you haven’t already, give team members an opportunity to complete a 360° evaluation of you as a team
leader. (Use the 360° Evaluation resource.) Finally, present a 5- to 7-minute speech in your club about the lessons
learned meeting or your leadership experience.</p>
