<p>This project addresses strategies for improving your personal interactions by understanding the impact of your attitudes and thoughts on daily interactions.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> The purpose of this project is to practice being aware of your thoughts and feelings, as well as the impact of your responses on others.</p>
<p><strong>Overview:</strong> Keep a daily record of your moods and attitudes for a minimum of two weeks, noting when you feel positive or negative, your successes and efforts, and three things for which you are grateful. Record and evaluate any changes in your behavior or the behavior of those around you. At a club meeting, share some aspect of your experience. You may choose to schedule a 2-to 3-minute report or a 5-to 7-minute speech. After completing your speech, submit your signed Project Completion Form to your vice president education to indicate you completed the journal.</p>
