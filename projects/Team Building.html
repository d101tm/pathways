<p>This project addresses the benefits of team building. It is designed to help you build a sense of collaboration and
trust within a team completing a project.</p>
<p><strong>Purpose:</strong> The purpose of this project is to practice the skills needed to build a cohesive team and host an event</p>
<p><strong>Overview:</strong> Build and work with a small team to design and host a team-building event, either in your Toastmasters
club or another environment. Any non-Toastmasters event must be approved by your club’s vice president
education and attended by a member of your club leadership team. Before the event, deliver a 2- to 3-minute
report at a club meeting to share your plans. After the event, deliver a 5- to 7-minute speech to your club. The
content of the speech is up to you, but needs to be about your event, the impact of leading on you and your team,
or the impact of building a team on you as a leader.</p>
